# 10 Tips for Getting the Most Out of AI-Powered Development

AI-powered development tools like OtterAI are transforming how we build software. But like any tool, knowing how to use it effectively makes all the difference. Here are 10 tips to help you get the most out of your AI coding assistant.

## 1. Be Specific About What You Want

Instead of saying "build me a website," try:
> "Create a portfolio website with a hero section, an about page, a projects grid showing 6 projects, and a contact form. Use a modern dark theme with blue accents."

**Why it works**: Specific requirements give the AI clear goals and reduce back-and-forth iterations.

## 2. Break Complex Projects into Steps

Don't try to build everything at once. Start with:
1. The core functionality
2. The main user interface
3. Additional features
4. Polish and refinements

**Example**: For a todo app, first build the basic add/delete functionality, then add filters, then styling, then data persistence.

## 3. Provide Examples When Possible

If you have a design or app you like, mention it:
> "Create a dashboard similar to Notion, with a sidebar for navigation and cards for different sections."

Visual or functional references help the AI understand your vision.

## 4. Use Iterative Refinement

Think of working with AI like sculpting:
- Start with the basic shape (core features)
- Add details (styling, animations)
- Polish (edge cases, error handling)

Each iteration builds on the previous one.

## 5. Ask for Explanations

Don't just accept the generated code. Ask questions:
- "Why did you use this approach?"
- "What does this function do?"
- "Are there alternative ways to implement this?"

Understanding the code makes you a better developer.

## 6. Specify Your Tech Stack

If you have preferences, mention them:
> "Use React with TypeScript, Tailwind for styling, and Firebase for the backend."

This ensures the AI uses technologies you're comfortable with.

## 7. Request Best Practices

Add phrases like:
- "Follow React best practices"
- "Include error handling"
- "Make it accessible"
- "Optimize for performance"

The AI will incorporate industry standards into the code.

## 8. Test Edge Cases

After getting the initial implementation, ask:
> "What happens if a user enters invalid data?"
> "How does this handle mobile devices?"
> "What if the API call fails?"

Good software handles unexpected situations gracefully.

## 9. Request Comments and Documentation

Ask for:
- Inline code comments
- README files
- API documentation
- Usage examples

This makes your code maintainable and easier to understand.

## 10. Iterate Based on Testing

After seeing the preview:
1. Test the functionality
2. Note what works and what doesn't
3. Give specific feedback
4. Request targeted improvements

**Example**: "The form works great, but can you add validation for the email field and show error messages in red?"

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ‚ùå Being Too Vague
"Make it better" doesn't give the AI actionable direction.

### ‚ùå Changing Everything at Once
Tackle one issue at a time to avoid confusion.

### ‚ùå Not Testing
Always preview and test the generated code.

### ‚ùå Ignoring Errors
If something doesn't work, describe the error to the AI.

## Pro Tips

### Use Templates as Starting Points
Browse our template library to find something close to your vision, then customize it.

### Learn from Generated Code
Study the patterns and techniques the AI uses. You'll become a better developer.

### Save Your Successful Prompts
Keep a collection of prompts that worked well for future reference.

### Experiment Freely
It's easy to undo changes or start over. Don't be afraid to try different approaches.

## Conclusion

AI-powered development is a skill that improves with practice. The more you work with AI, the better you'll become at communicating your vision and understanding the generated code.

Remember: The AI is your collaborator, not a magic wand. The best results come from clear communication, iterative refinement, and testing.

Happy building! üöÄ
