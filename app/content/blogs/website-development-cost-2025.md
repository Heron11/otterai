## Money-Saving Tips

### 1. Start Simple
Build core features first. Add nice-to-haves later when you have revenue.

### 2. Use Standard Solutions
Custom features cost 10x standard ones. If a plugin exists, use it.

### 3. Provide Your Own Content
Writing and images from you saves $2,000-$10,000.

### 4. Choose the Right Platform
Pick something that matches your skills and budget.

### 5. Plan Thoroughly
Changes mid-project cost 3-5x more than getting it right initially.

### 6. Get Multiple Quotes
Compare at least 3 options before deciding.

### 7. Negotiate
Especially with freelancers and small agencies, rates are often flexible.

### 8. Phase the Project
Launch with essentials, add features after you validate.

## Red Flags to Watch For

**Too cheap:** If it seems too good to be true (professional site for $500), it probably is.

**No contract:** Always get scope, timeline, and costs in writing.

**100% upfront payment:** Standard is 25-50% upfront, rest on milestones.

**Vague timeline:** "A few weeks" isn't specific enough.

**Poor communication:** If they're slow to respond during sales, imagine after payment.

**No portfolio:** See examples of their actual work.

## Conclusion: What Should You Spend?

There's no universal right answer. The best choice depends on:
- Your budget
- Your timeline
- Your technical skills
- Your business goals
- How critical the website is to your business

**General recommendations:**

**Choose DIY/AI tools if:**
- Budget under $2,000
- Need it in days, not months
- Testing a business idea
- Have time but not money

**Choose freelancer if:**
- Budget $2,000-$10,000
- Need more customization
- Want balance of cost and quality
- Can manage the project

**Choose agency if:**
- Budget $10,000+
- Need professional quality
- Want comprehensive service
- Have complex requirements

**Remember:** A $500 website that launches beats a $50,000 website that never gets finished. Start with what you can afford, validate your business, then upgrade when revenue justifies it.

The goal isn't to have the most expensive website. It's to have a website that effectively serves your business goals at a price you can afford.
