# Project-Centric Architecture Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a project-centric architecture that separates projects from chat sessions, enabling proper file loading, project isolation, and fresh chat sessions within existing projects.

## What Changed

### 1. **New Project Loader Service** (`app/lib/services/project-loader.client.ts`)
- Loads project files directly from R2 storage via API
- Returns files as a simple Record<string, string> format
- Handles errors gracefully with detailed logging

### 2. **Workbench Enhancements** (`app/lib/stores/workbench.ts`)
Added two key methods:
- `resetWorkbench()`: Clears all artifacts, files, and state for clean slate
- `loadProjectFiles(files, projectName)`: Directly loads files into WebContainer, bypassing message parser

### 3. **Project Context Store** (`app/lib/stores/project-context.ts`)
- Tracks currently active project
- Provides project ID and name to sync services
- Automatically cleared when leaving project route

### 4. **New Project Route** (`app/routes/project.$projectId.tsx`)
- `/project/:projectId` - Project-first workspace
- Loads project metadata from D1
- Fetches files from R2 storage
- Resets workbench to clean state
- Initializes project context
- Shows loading states and error handling
- Allows fresh chat sessions within project context

### 5. **Enhanced Project Sync** (`app/lib/services/project-sync-v2.client.ts`)
- Checks for project context first (new behavior)
- If project context exists: syncs directly to `/api/projects/:projectId/files`
- If no context: falls back to chat-based sync (legacy behavior)
- Maintains backward compatibility

### 6. **Updated Navigation** (`app/components/platform/projects/ProjectCard.tsx`)
- Changed from `/chat/:chatId` to `/project/:projectId`
- Projects now open in project-centric workspace

### 7. **Updated Components**
- `Chat.client.tsx`: Uses new sync service with project context
- `Workbench.client.tsx`: Uses new sync service with project context

## Architecture Benefits

### ✅ **Clean Project Isolation**
- Each project opens with a fresh workbench state
- No file pollution from previous sessions
- Files loaded directly from R2, not reconstructed from chat history

### ✅ **R2 as Source of Truth**
- Files are now read from R2 storage
- No longer dependent on IndexedDB chat messages
- Eliminates expensive message replay on every project open

### ✅ **Fresh Chat Sessions**
- Open existing projects and start new conversations
- Project files persist across multiple chat sessions
- Chat history doesn't dictate project state

### ✅ **Proper File Management**
- Direct file loading bypasses artifact system
- WebContainer filesystem populated efficiently
- File changes sync back to R2 storage

### ✅ **Backward Compatibility**
- Legacy chat-based flow still works
- New projects created via chat continue functioning
- Gradual migration path for existing data

## URL Structure

### Before:
```
/projects              → List of projects
/chat/:chatId          → Opens chat (project tied to chat)
```

### After:
```
/projects              → List of projects
/project/:projectId    → Opens project workspace
/chat/:chatId          → Still works (legacy)
```

## Data Flow

### Opening a Project:
1. User clicks project card
2. Navigate to `/project/:projectId`
3. Load project metadata from D1
4. Fetch files from R2 storage
5. Reset workbench to clean state
6. Set project context (projectId, projectName)
7. Load files directly into WebContainer
8. Show workbench with project files
9. Start fresh chat session

### Saving Changes:
1. User modifies files or AI generates new ones
2. On AI completion or manual save
3. Check for project context
4. If context exists: POST to `/api/projects/:projectId/files`
5. Files saved to R2 under `projects/:projectId/`
6. D1 metadata updated (file count, size, timestamp)

## Migration Notes

### Existing Projects
- Already have files in R2 (from previous sync)
- Can be opened immediately via new route
- No data migration needed

### New Projects
- Created via chat continue to work
- Synced to R2 automatically
- Can be opened via project route

### Chat Sessions
- Legacy `/chat/:chatId` routes still work
- Will reconstruct from message history (old behavior)
- Gradually migrate to project-based workflow

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Open existing project with files
- [ ] Verify files load in workbench
- [ ] Verify file tree displays correctly
- [ ] Edit a file and verify it syncs
- [ ] Create new files via AI chat
- [ ] Verify new files sync to project
- [ ] Close and reopen project
- [ ] Verify files persist correctly
- [ ] Test with empty project (no files)
- [ ] Test project deletion
- [ ] Verify backward compatibility with old chat routes

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multiple Chat Sessions per Project**
   - Store chat history linked to projects
   - View past conversations within project

2. **Project Collaboration**
   - Share projects with other users
   - Real-time collaboration features

3. **Project Templates**
   - Create new projects from templates
   - Pre-populate files on project creation

4. **Project Versioning**
   - Track file changes over time
   - Restore previous versions

5. **Project Export/Import**
   - Download entire project as ZIP
   - Import projects from GitHub repos
