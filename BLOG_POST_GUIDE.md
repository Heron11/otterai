- Examples: `[Tutorial, Stripe, Payments]`, `[Business, MVP, Startup]`
- Tag ideas: Tutorial, Business, AI, Web Development, SaaS, Startup, No-Code, Case Study, Tips & Tricks, Tools, Comparison, Security, Performance

### Content Structure for SEO
1. **Hook in first paragraph** - address search intent immediately
